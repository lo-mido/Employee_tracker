# Employee Tracker
## Description

This application was developed to empower users in effectively managing employee information by enabling them to create custom tables. These tables comprehensively document employee details, including unique IDs, specified roles, assigned managers, and designated departments. Our application offers the convenience of dynamic and swift table creation, streamlining the process for users.

To utilize this application, users are required to download the software onto their local computer. Once the application is successfully downloaded, users can access its functionality through the command line interface. The application guides users by prompting them with questions regarding their preferences for viewing or adding information to their tables. This intuitive interface allows users to seamlessly interact with the application.

Under the hood, this application leverages the power of MYSQL, inquirer, and console tables, providing users with a robust and efficient toolkit for managing employee data. For a step-by-step demonstration of the application's features, please refer to the linked walkthrough video below.
